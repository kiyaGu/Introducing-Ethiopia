        <p>
          Ethiopia is Africa's oldest independent country and its second largest in terms of population. Apart from a five-year occupation by Mussolini's Italy, it has never been colonised.
          It has a unique cultural heritage, being the home of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church - one of the oldest Christian churches - and a monarchy that ended only in the coup of 1974.
          It served as a symbol of African independence throughout the colonial period, and was a founder member of the United Nations and the African base for many international organisations.
          Ethiopia has suffered periodic droughts and famines that lead to a long civil conflict in the 20th Century and a border war with Eritrea.

            <h2>Aksum</h2>
            <p>
               The Kingdom of Aksum or Axum, also known as the Aksumite Empire, was a trading nation in the area of Eritrea and Northern Ethiopia. It existed from approximately 100–940 AD.
               The Axumites erected a number of large stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world,
               standing at 90 feet. Under Ezana (fl. 320–360) Aksum adopted Christianity. In the 7th century, early Muslims from Mecca also sought refuge from Quraysh persecution by travelling to the kingdom,
               a journey known in Islamic history as the First Hijra.

            <h2>Lalibela</h2>
            <p>
               Lalibela (Amharic: ላሊበላ) is a town in Amhara Region, northern Ethiopia famous for monolithic rock-cut churches.
                Lalibela is one of Ethiopia's holiest cities, second only to Aksum, and a center of pilgrimage. Unlike Aksum,
                the population of Lalibela is almost completely Ethiopian Orthodox Christian. Ethiopia is one of the earliest
                nations to adopt Christianity in the first half of the fourth century, and its historical roots date to the time of the Apostles.

            <p>
               Fasilides (Ge'ez ፋሲልደስ Fāsīladas, modern Fāsīledes; 20 November 1603 – 18 October 1667), also known as Fasil[1] or Basilide, was emperor of Ethiopia from 1632 to 18 October 1667,
               and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. His throne name was ʿAlam Sagad (Ge'ez ዓለም ሰገድ ʿĀlam Sagad, modern ʿĀlem Seged), meaning "to whom the world bows". He was the son of Emperor Susenyos I
               and Empress Sultana Mogassa, born at Magazaz in Shewa before 10 November 1603. His paternal grandfather's name was also Fasilides.

            <h2>Harar</h2>
            <p>
              World Heritage–listed Harar (ሐረር) is a place apart. With its 368 alleyways squeezed into just 1 sq km, it’s more reminiscent of Fez in Morocco than any other city in the Horn.
              Its countless mosques and shrines, animated markets, crumbling walls and charming people will make you feel as if you’ve floated right out of the 21st century.
              It’s the east’s most memorable sight and shouldn’t be missed. As if that wasn’t enough, there are many chances to get up close and personal with wild hyenas.
              It’s a rare traveller who doesn’t enjoy it here. <button type="button" name="button"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harar" target="_blank">Read more</a></button>

            <h2>Ark of Covenant</h2>
            <p>
              The Ethiopian Orthodox Church claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant, or Tabot, in Axum. The object is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion.
              Replicas of the Axum tabot are kept in every Ethiopian church, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Mary, George and Michael.
              The Kebra Nagast, composed to legitimise the new dynasty ruling Ethiopia following its establishment in 1270, narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to
              Ethiopia by Menelik I with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem.

            <h2>Jimma Abajiffar</h2>
            <p>
              Jimma (Oromo: Jimma, Amharic: ጅማ?), also spelled Jima, is the largest city in south-western Ethiopia. It is a special zone of the Oromia Region and is surrounded by Jimma Zone.
              It has a latitude and longitude of 7°40′N 36°50′E. The town was the capital of Kaffa Province until the province was dissolved. Prior to the 2007 census, Jimma was reorganized administratively as a special Zone.
              Herbert S. Lewis states that in the early 1960s it was &quot;the greatest market in all of south-western Ethiopia. On a good day in the dry season it attracts up to thirty thousand people.&quot;

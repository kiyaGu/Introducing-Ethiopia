        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Ethiopia, which is officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (የኢትዮጵያ ፌዴራላዊ ዲሞክራሲያዊ ሪፐብሊክ), is a country located in the Horn of Africa.
          It shares borders with Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south.
          With nearly 100 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most populous nation on the African
          continent after Nigeria. It occupies a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 sq mi), and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the oldest evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia, which is widely considered the region from which modern humans
          first set out for the Middle East and places beyond. According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn
          region during the ensuing Neolithic era.

            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>
               Ethiopia is in east-central Africa, bordered on the west by the Sudan, the east by Somalia and Djibouti,
               the south by Kenya, and the northeast by Eritrea. It has several high mountains, the highest of which is
               Ras Dashan at 15,158 ft (4,620 m). The Blue Nile, or Abbai, rises in the northwest and flows in a great
               semicircle before entering the Sudan. Its chief reservoir, Lake Tana, lies in the northwest.

             Modern Ethiopia emerged under Emperor Menelik II, who established its independence by routing an Italian invasion in 1896.
             He expanded Ethiopia by conquest. Disorders that followed Menelik's death brought his daughter to the throne in 1917, with his cousin,
             Tafari Makonnen, as regent and heir apparent. When the empress died in 1930, Tafari was crowned Emperor Haile Selassie I.

            <h2>Ethnic groups of Ethiopia</h2>
            <p>
               Hamitic peoples migrated to Ethiopia from Asia Minor in prehistoric times. Semitic traders from Arabia penetrated the region in the 7th
               century B.C. Its Red Sea ports were important to the Roman and Byzantine Empires. Coptic Christianity was brought to the region in A.D. 341,
               and a variant of it became Ethiopia's state religion. Ancient Ethiopia reached its peak in the 5th century, then was isolated by the rise of
               Islam and weakened by feudal wars.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are over 80 different languages spoken in Ethiopia. The most widely spoken of these are Oromo and Amharic. Luckily for foreign travellers,
               English and Arabic are also widely spoken. Ethiopian children must learn both their tribal language and the country’s official language of Amharic.
               They must also have a good grasp of English by the time they start secondary school. From the age of 12 onwards, all school lessons are carried out in English.

          <h2>Ethiopian Culture</h2>
          <p>Ethiopia has a diverse mix of ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. It is a country with more than 80 different ethnic groups each with
            its own language, culture, custom and tradition. One of the most significant areas of Ethiopian culture is its literature, which is
            represented predominantly by translations from ancient Greek and Hebrew religious texts into the ancient language Ge'ez,
            modern Amharic and Tigrigna languages.

                <p>The Ethiopian national dish is called wat. It is a hot spicy stew accompanied by injera (traditional large spongy pancake made of teff flour and water).
                  Teff is unique to the country and is grown on the Ethiopian highlands. There are many varieties of wat, e.g. chicken, beef, lamb, vegetables, lentils,
                  and ground split peas stewed with hot spice called berbere. Berbere is made of dried red hot pepper, herbs, spices, dried onions, dried garlic and salt ingredients.
                  Wat is served by placing it on top of the injera which is served in a mesob (large basket tray). The food is eaten with fingers by tearing off a piece of injera and dipping it in the wat.

                First the coffee is roasted, then ground and placed in a Jebena (coffee pot) with boiling water. When ready it is then served to people in little cups,
                up to three times per ceremony. Other locally produced beverages are tella and tej, which are served and drunk on major religious festivals, Saints Days
                and weddings. Tella and tej are also sold by numerous designated commercial houses all over the country.

              <h3>Ethiopian Music</h3>
              <p>The music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of Ethiopia's ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Some forms of traditional music are strongly
                 influenced by folk music from elsewhere in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopian music uses a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals
                 between some notes. As with many other aspects of Ethiopian culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in neighboring Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti and Sudan.
